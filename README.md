# Hindustanpost — Next.js news demo

This repository is a small Next.js + TypeScript demo for a news site called "Hindustanpost".

Quick start (PowerShell):

```powershell
cd "d:\\Jay patel Project\\Hindusthanpost"
npm install
npm run dev
```

The dev server will run on http://localhost:3000. The demo includes a small set of sample articles served from a local API route at `/api/articles` and clickable article pages under `/articles/[slug]`.

Build for production:

```powershell
npm run build; npm start
```

Lint:

```powershell
npm run lint
```

If you'd like Tailwind, authentication, a CMS, or more realistic sample data, tell me and I can add it.
